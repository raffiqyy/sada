          I hope i remind you of the color yellow. the color of sunsets and
          sunrise as new spring beginings come and go. the color of summer sand
          as it courses throught your sun kissed fingers. the color of the
          autumn leaves as they crunch beneath your boots. the color of city
          lights illuminating the snowy winter streets. the color of clarity and
          of loyalty. i hope i remind you of the color yellow, because that's
          the color that reminds me of you. your smile is as beutiful as rose,
          and i hope you can alwys smilee. I LOVED YOU
